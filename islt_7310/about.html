        <h2 class="amheading">About Me</h2>
        <p class="aboutme"> My name is Curtis Thomas. I’m a middle school librarian in Springfield, MO. My wife teaches 3rd grade. We have two sons, a three year old and a nine month old. In my free time I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy (or just about anything else I can get my hands on). I also like playing video games and spending time with my family. I was a high school English teacher before becoming a school librarian. I taught anything from core English courses to film and broadcast to running the yearbook. I also spent time as a college teacher while earning my Master’s degree in English. Now I get to combine my passion for reading with my love of technology, working with teachers and students to <strong>learn, research, and create</strong>. One of my <em>favorite</em> parts of my job is helping a reluctant reader find a book they <em>love</em>. I also love trying new tech tools and sharing them with teachers. <br> <a href="/islt_7310/resume.pdf"> View My Resume </a> </p>
