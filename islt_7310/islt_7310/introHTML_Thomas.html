     My Name is Curtis Thomas. I am a middle school librarian in Springfield, MO. I was a high school English teacher before becoming a school librarian. I taught anything from core English courses to film and broadcast to running the yearbook. I also spent time as a college teacher while earning my Master’s degree in English. I don’t have web development training or experience, other than building websites using apps like Wix. I’m expecting to learn the basics of HTML and CSS in this course. I hope to use the skill I gain in this class to create a website for my school library. Knowing HTML will also help me edit pages in Canvas more skillfully. In my free time I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy (or just about anything else I can get my hands on). I also like playing video games and spending time with my family.
