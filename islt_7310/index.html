        <h2>About This Site</h2> 
        
        <p>The purpose of this website is to provide some information about me as an educator, some essential information about news literacy, and some resources for learning more. The goal of this website is to provide the skills you need to be news literate in the 21st century. By “news literate,” I mean being able to find trustworthy information about what’s going on in your community and around the world. You will learn how to “zone” information based on its main purpose, how to quickly judge if a piece of information is credible, and how to do a reverse image search. In today’s world, with so much being shared online that is misleading or downright wrong, it has never been more important to be able to sort through all of the posts, videos, articles, and notifications that are thrown our way twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week. This website is a starting place for becoming more news savvy, so you can keep yourself from being led down a rabbit hole of rumors and lies.</p></main>
