        <p class="zonep"> Whether you’re reading an article on a news website, scrolling through TikTok, or watching videos on YouTube, it’s important to be able to know what kind of information you’re dealing with. The first step is zoning information based on its main purpose. Knowing the main purpose of a piece of content will help you know if you can trust it. There are six main purposes to consider: to inform, to persuade, to entertain, to sell, to provoke, and to document. Something designed to inform you attempts to provide facts without bias. It gives you the “who, what, when, where, why” of an event or incident. Something made to persuade you uses evidence and reasoning to try to convince you of a point of view or to get you to take some sort of action. Things intended to entertain you are designed to make you feel good or draw you into a story. Something made to sell you something tries to get you to spend money on a service or product. Something designed to provoke you twists or makes up facts to get a strong emotional reaction, often anger or fear. And finally, something designed to document gathers information to serve as a record of an event or incident. Becoming familiar with these six purposes will make it much easier to figure out if what you’re looking at is likely to give you accurate information.</p>
        
        <h2 id="sift" class="siftheading">S.I.F.T.</h2>
        
         <img class="siftimage" src="/islt_7310/images/sift.png" alt="sift"> 
        
        <p class="siftp">To evaluate a piece of information beyond identifying its main purpose, think S.I.F.T. SIFT is an acronym that can help you remember four quick and easy steps for figuring out if the video, article, or post you’re looking at is giving you accurate information. The first and most important step is to STOP. Pause before moving on or especially before sharing something. Notice your emotions. If you’re feeling strongly about what you’ve watched or read, avoid sharing before looking more closely at its claims. The next step is to INVESTIGATE the source. Open a new tab and search for the outlet and/or author. What can you find about the outlet’s history, the author’s expertise, or any possible biases they might have? Next, FIND other coverage. Look for stories from reputable news outlets such as NPR or the Associated Press or fact-checking articles from websites like Snopes or Lead Stories. Are they reporting on that event or issue? Do they confirm what you initially read or watched? And finally, TRACE content back to its original source. Try to find where a photo or video was first shared online, or where a news story first broke.</p>
        
        <h2 id="search" class="searchheading">Reverse Image Search</h2>
        
     <img class="searchimage" src="/islt_7310/images/search.png" alt="sift"> 
        
        <p class="searchp">Reverse image search is a powerful tool that can help make some of the steps in the SIFT process easier. So much of what we encounter online is image- or video-based, and knowing how to find a specific image online is a must-have skill for news literate people. Whether you’re searching for other coverage or tracing content back to its original source, searching the internet for a specific image can show you where else that image has been shared online, possibly leading to where it was shared online first, articles covering the same story, or fact-checking articles that can help you figure out if an image has been photoshopped or shared out of context.</p>
